# daily-notes
Created with CodeSandbox

This project is developed using React in JavaScript.

The project is an interactive online memo that consists of a time recorder with a specific description on the left side and a to-do list form on the right.

User Guide:
To add a note, users can fill in the content in the form on the left and click the "+" button in the lower right corner. The note will then appear below. If the user wishes to delete a note, they can press the "-" button in the lower right corner of the form. For the to-do list on the right, the user can fill in the task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the list. Once a task is completed, the user can delete it by clicking on the event.

Special Note:
- Data is not automatically saved when the user refreshes the URL. Therefore, it's recommended to copy and save important information elsewhere.
- The web page rendering may appear more stylish on MacOS systems due to font selection. However, this does not affect the functionality of the project.
